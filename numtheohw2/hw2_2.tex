\question{
    Prove that a square is either
    divisible by 4 or
    leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.
}

\begin{solution}
    For some $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, if n is
    in the form $2k$ for some integer $k$,
    then obviously $4|n^2$.$\\\\$
    But then, if $n=2k+1$ for some
    $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, then
    $n^2=4k^2+4k+1=4(k^2+k)+1$. Since,
    $n^2$ can be written as $4k+1$, we get
    a remainder of 1 when dividing $n^2$ by 4.
\end{solution}
