\question{
    Give 3 different fun facts
    about the number 2019.
    Note that there is no formal
    definition of fun fact,
    so be creative.
    For each fun fact find another
    number that has the same fun
    fact or state why one is not
    possible. Find an example and
    counterexample
    to the fun fact.

\begin{solution}
    \begin{parts}
        \part{
            The lowest prime that divides
            that divides 2019. The only
            other prime is 673. The difference
            here is 670. The next number with
            such property is 4739.
        }
        \part{
            Current year is 2019. There's
            no other number that's current
            year.
        }
        \part{
            $2019^2=4076361$. Sum of digits of
            the square is 27 which equals
            $(2+0+1)*9$.
