\question{
        In class, Craig noticed that a square number is
        just the sum of two triangular numbers;
        $s_n=t_n+t_{n-1}$.  A similar pattern is true
        for other polygonal numbers.  Show that the
        hexagonal numbers $h_n=p_n +t_{n-1}$ is the
        sum of a pentagonal number and a triagular
        number.  You may give a geometric or
        algebraic proof.

\begin{solution}
        We see that
        \begin{align*}
            p_n+t_{n-1} &= \frac{n(3n-1)}{2} +\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\
            &= \frac{n}{2}\left(3n-1+n-1\right)\\
            &=n(2n-1) = h_n
        \end{align*}
\end{solution}
